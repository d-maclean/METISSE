    !--- HOW TO DEAL WITH INCOMPLETE TRACKS--------

    ! For a given initial mass, METISSE calculates an evolutionary track
    ! by interpolating between the corresponding EEPs of neighbouring mass
    ! tracks. If any of the neighbouring tracks is incomplete, the
    ! interpolated track is also rendered incomplete.
    ! This section explains how METIISE identifies incomplete tracks
    ! and attempts to fill in the missing data.
    
    ! the completeness of tracks is determined by the following two:
    ! Final eep for stars with M< Mec
    low_mass_final_eep = -1
    ! Final for stars with M>= Mec
    high_mass_final_eep = -1
    

    ! if fix_track is true,  METISSE relaxes criteria for finding
    ! neighboring tracks to fix incomplete tracks.
    
    fix_track = .true.
    
    ! Determines the mass range for searching neighboring tracks
    ! when fixing incomplete tracks.
    ! The range is M-(M*lookup_index) and M+(M*lookup_index),
    ! where M is the initial mass of the star.
 
    lookup_index = 1.0
