    ! Mhook - Mass below which hook does not appear on the MS.

    ! Mhef - Mass above which helium ignition occurs non-degenerately.
    ! Mfgb - Mass above which helium ignition occurs on the HG.
    ! Mup - Mass below which carbon ignition does not occur.
    ! Mec - Mass above which carbon ignites in the centre.
    ! If negative, these values are calculated by the code.
