    ! Mhook - Mass above which hook feature starts to appear on the MS.
    ! Mhef - Mass above which helium ignition occurs non-degenerately in the core.
    ! Mfgb - Mass above which helium ignition occurs on the HG.
    ! Mup - Mass above which off-centre C/O ignition can occur non-degenerately in the core.
    ! Mec - Mass which a star avoids electron captures on neon and proceeds to form an iron core.
    ! If negative, these values are calculated by the code.
